      <strong className="block mb-1">Who are you? Who are New Leaf Liberals?</strong>
      <span className="text-gray-700">
        We're card carrying, rank-and-file Ontario Liberals. We don't support any particular leadership candidate, and we aren't funded
        whatsoever. We've come together to brainstorm a new direction for our party, and hope you will see value in the future we envision
        for the OLP.

      <strong className="block mb-1">Are you supported by a potential leadership candidate?</strong>
      <span className="text-gray-700">
        No. We're an open group of Ontario Liberals, connected by our mutual hope to reform our party and form government in 2029.

      <strong className="block mb-1">Why do you want an open leadership contest in 2026?</strong>
      <span className="text-gray-700">
        We believe that an open and condensed leadership contest can attract new talent, new members, and new funds to our party. We want
        to see a wide field of candidates, who, win or lose, will be committed to building a party that can win in 2029. It shouldn't be a
        Bonnie or not Bonnie question, it needs to be "Who's best to lead our party into 2029?".

    <div className="mb-5">
      <strong className="block mb-1">Is this mostly to do with Bonnie Crombie's leadership review?</strong>
      <span className="text-gray-700">
        The problems we've outlined have existed in our party long before Bonnie was elected leader. While we are encouraging an open
        contest for leader, we've also created a list of other priorities that are equally as important, no matter who our party leader
        is.
