    a: `We're card carrying, rank-and-file Ontario Liberals. We don't support any particular leadership candidate, and we aren't funded whatsoever. We've come together to brainstorm a new direction for our party, and hope you will see value in the future we envision for the OLP.`
  },
  {
    q: 'Are you supported by a potential leadership candidate?',
    a: `No. We're an open group of Ontario Liberals, connected by our mutual hope to reform our party and form government in 2029.`
  },
  {
    q: 'Why do you want an open leadership contest in 2026?',
    a: `We believe that an open and condensed leadership contest can attract new talent, new members, and new funds to our party. We want to see a wide field of candidates, who, win or lose, will be committed to building a party that can win in 2029. It shouldn't be a Bonnie or not Bonnie question, it needs to be "Who's best to lead our party into 2029?".`
  },
  {
    q: `Is this mostly to do with Bonnie Crombie's leadership review?`,
    a: `The problems we've outlined have existed in our party long before Bonnie was elected leader. While we are encouraging an open contest for leader, we've also created a list of other priorities that are equally as important, no matter who our party leader is.`
